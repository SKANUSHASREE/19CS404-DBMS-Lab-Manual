# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to Find employees who have an age less than the average age of employees with incomes over 1 million

```sql
select * from employee
where age < (SELECT AVG(age) FROM Employee WHERE income > 1000000);
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find the order values greater than the average order value of 10th October 2012. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

```sql
select * from orders
where purch_amt>(select avg(purch_amt) from orders where ord_date="2012-10-10");
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length

```sql
select department_id as depar, department_name from departments
where length(department_name)>(select avg(length(department_name)) from departments)
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT
  student_name,
  grade
FROM GRADES
WHERE grade = (
  SELECT MAX(grade)
  FROM GRADES as g2
  WHERE g2.subject = GRADES.subject
);
```

**Output:**

where salesman_id in (select salesman_id from salesman where city="London");
```

**Output:**
